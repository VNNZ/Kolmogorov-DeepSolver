# Kolmogorov-DeepSolver
In this notebook we demonstrate a method for solving high-dimensional Kolmogorov PDEs that uses a deep neural network in conjunction with the Feynman-Kac connection.

We present a class-based implementation of the procedure described in [Jan Blechschmidt's notebook](https://github.com/janblechschmidt/PDEsByNNs/blob/main/Feynman_Kac_Solver.ipynb),
which in turn seeks to reproduce the results from the paper
